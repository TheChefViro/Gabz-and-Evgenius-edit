                FOR REVIVAL RP

          This for Devs and MLO people to understand.


1.It crashed because you did not deleted the lower pillboxes YBN and YDR (look above)

2.To fix the player flickering you need to add the interior into what's called (INTERIORPROXIES.META) this goes for any MLO that is trying to be used in One-Sync server.

3.So before yelling,kicking and screaming like a little girl, think and ask for help.
